 code for various computer vision problems. The library is compatible with
 IPL (Intel's Image Processing Library) and, if available, can use IPP
 (Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives) for better performance.
 .
 OpenCV provides low level portable data types and operators, and a set
 of high level functionalities for video acquisition, image processing and
 analysis, structural analysis, motion analysis and object tracking, object
 recognition, camera calibration and 3D reconstruction.
